Three issues discussed and explored here

1.  **filter** a Tibble for ggplot/vis (**Trade_SSA.Rmd**)
1. **reactivity** in **Shiny**.  How to use the filtering demonstrated above to enable a user to choose variables that result in reactive filtering (**trade_app.R**)
1. **time series**.  By converting the *tibble* to a *time series*, it is now possible to invoke the interactivity of dygraphs (**wrangle_gather.Rmd**)
