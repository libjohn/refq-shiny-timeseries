Three issues discussed and explored here

1.  **filter** a Tibble for ggplot/vis
2.  **reactivity** in **Shiny**. How to use the filtering demonstrated above to enable a user to choose variables that result in reactive filtering
3.  **time series**. By converting the *tibble* to a *time series*, it is now possible to invoke the interactivity of dygraphs
